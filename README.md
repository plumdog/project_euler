Project Euler Solutions
=======================

Because all great journeys start with plenty of ambition and a README.md file.

Aims and Restrictions
---------------------

* Primary aim is to become a better and more well rounded programmer,
  hopefully by using some of my lesser frequented languages for
  solving things.

* Also to get my Maths brain working harder.

* But I also intend to try to keep my solutions more about programming
  rather than maths. (That is, LaTeX is not a valid language)
